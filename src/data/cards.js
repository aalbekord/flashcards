  { front: "What is Encapsulation?", back: "The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, like a class.", difficulty: "easy" },
  { front: "What is Abstraction?", back: "Hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.", difficulty: "medium" },
  { front: "What is Inheritance?", back: "A mechanism where one class can derive properties and behavior from another class.", difficulty: "medium" },
  { front: "What is Polymorphism?", back: "The ability of different objects to respond uniquely to the same method or function call.", difficulty: "hard" },
  { front: "What is a Class in OOP?", back: "A blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors.", difficulty: "easy" },
  { front: "What is an Object in OOP?", back: "An instance of a class that contains data and methods to manipulate that data.", difficulty: "easy" },
  { front: "What is a Constructor in OOP?", back: "A special method used to initialize objects when they are created.", difficulty: "easy" },
  { front: "What is the 'this' keyword in OOP?", back: "A reference to the current instance of the class.", difficulty: "medium" },
  { front: "What is a Method in OOP?", back: "A function defined inside a class that operates on the data of the object.", difficulty: "easy" },
  { front: "What is the difference between Composition and Inheritance?", back: "Composition is a 'has-a' relationship, while inheritance is an 'is-a' relationship.", difficulty: "hard" },
  { front: "What is a Static Method?", back: "A method that belongs to the class rather than any object instance and can be called without creating an object.", difficulty: "medium" },
  { front: "What is the purpose of Interfaces in OOP?", back: "To define a contract that classes must follow, specifying methods without implementing them.", difficulty: "medium" },
  { front: "What is the difference between Abstract Classes and Interfaces?", back: "Abstract classes can have implemented methods, while interfaces only define method signatures.", difficulty: "hard" },
  { front: "What is the Single Responsibility Principle?", back: "A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job.", difficulty: "medium" },
  { front: "What is the Open/Closed Principle?", back: "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.", difficulty: "hard" },
  { front: "What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?", back: "Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the program.", difficulty: "hard" },
  { front: "What is the Interface Segregation Principle?", back: "A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.", difficulty: "medium" },
  { front: "What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?", back: "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.", difficulty: "hard" },
  { front: "What is the purpose of Design Patterns in OOP?", back: "To provide reusable solutions to common software design problems.", difficulty: "medium" }
